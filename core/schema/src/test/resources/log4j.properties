# 4) right click on your project in the Package Explorer - New - Folder - 
# in "Folder name" write "log4j" - click Advanced - select "Link to a folder in the
# file system" - create a new folder "log4j" in your project folder in the file system
# 5) Place this file you are reading right now in in the folder you just created.  Name
# the file as log4j.properties
# 6) In Eclipse: Run - Run... - In the navigation bar on the left select either the 
# server, or the runnable class, or the JUnit test you want to log with log4j -
